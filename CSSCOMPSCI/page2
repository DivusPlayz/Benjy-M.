          <h5>We Need to Stand Up</h5>
          <p>We need to stand up by not by suing or protesting but by understanding other people's perspective and put yourself in their shoes before you judge, yell or harass others. We can make sure people stop using those stereotypes and know that we are all humans we are no different than you.
